\subsection{Why \xmlToLy?}
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------

\mxml\ ({\it Music eXtended Markup Language}) is a specification language meant to represent music scores by texts, readable both by humans and computers. It has been designed by the W3C Music Notation Community Group (\url{https://www.w3.org/community/music-notation/}) to help sharing music score files between applications, through export and import mechanisms.

The homepage to \mxml\ is \url{https://www.musicxml.com}.

\mxml\ data contains very detailed information about the music score, and it is quite verbose by nature. This makes creating such data by hand quite difficult, and this is done by applications actually.

The \mxml\ data is not systematically checked for correctness. Checks are done, however, to ensure it won't crash due to missing values.
