\lib\ supplies a number of basic tools using its features:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt xmlread} converts MusicXML data and displays the corresponding xmlElement tree;

\item {\tt countnotes} reads MusicXML data and displays the number of notes it contains;

\item other programs such as {\tt xmltranspose} and {\tt partsummary} demonstrate the possibilities of the library, in particular those of the two-phase visitors pattern it uses.

\item {\tt xml2midi} reads MusicXML data and outputs a midi version of it.
\end{itemize}

It is to be noted that:
\begin{itemize}
\item \lily\ provides \midiToLy\ to translate MIDI files to \lily\ code;
\item \lily\ can generate MIDI files from its input.
\end{itemize}
