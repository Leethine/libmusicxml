A generator is an executable that creates data representing a score without reading any input file.
For example:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{RandomMusic} generates an mxmlelement tree containing random music, and writes it as \mxml\ to standard output;

\item \texttt{RandomChords} generates an mxmlelement tree containing random two-note chords, and writes it as \mxml\ to standard output;

\item \texttt{MusicAndHarmonies.cpp} generates an mxmlelement tree containing notes and harmonies, and writes it as \mxml\ to standard output;
\end{itemize}
