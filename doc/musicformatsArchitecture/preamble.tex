\abstract {
This document shows the architecture of the \formats\ library, to be found at 
\url {https://github.com/grame-cncm/libmusicxml/tree/lilypond}.

\formats\ is written in C++11 and provides a set of music scores representations and translators between various textual music scores formats. Building it only requires a C++11 compiler and {\tt cmake}.
