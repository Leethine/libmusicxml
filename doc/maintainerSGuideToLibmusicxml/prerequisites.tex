In order to maintain \lib, one needs to do the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item obtain a working knowledge of C++ programming. The code base of \lib\ uses classes, simple inheritance, and templates;

%%%%%%%%\item study \mxml, starting maybe from \docpdf{introductionToMusicXML}{IntroductionToMusicXML.tex}. A deep knowledge of that matter comes with experience;

\item study the architecture of \lib, which can be seen in figure \ref {Architecture}, page \pageref {Architecture}, and is presented in more detail in \url{https://github.com/grame-cncm/libmusicxml/blob/lilypond/doc/libmusicxmlArchitecture/libmusicxmlArchitecture.pdf}
\end{itemize}
