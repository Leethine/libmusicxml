Many thanks to Dominique Fober, the designer and maintainer of the \lib\ library. This author would not have attempted to work on a \mxml\ to \lily\ translator without it already available.

In particular, the conversion of \mxml\ data to a tree is extremely well done directly from the \mxml\ DTD, and that was a necessary step to produce \lily\ code. Dominique also provided a nice way to browse this tree with a two-phase visitor designe pattern, which this author used extensively in his own code. The interested reader can find information about that in \docpdf{presentation}{libmusicxml2.pdf}.

\xmlToLy\ and some of the specific examples presented in this document are this author's contribution to \lib.
